This project is related to mine because they have used some kind of "motor" to keep the colors changing and spinning, where in my project, I have also used a motor, and in one of my very first attempt of my project I though of the same conecpt where i have a big scroll that changes color as well.

This project is related to mine because they have also used motor in their project, where they use the motor to shake the bottle which while the bottle is shaking the bottle moves from its initial position, we kind of share to same concept on motors and this is also one of the project people can play for a long time and spend time watching it while doing nothing which is what I am looking for for my project.

*Kinetic Wall: Arduino Spiral Wall*

This project is related to mine because they have also used motor in their project, in this project, they use the motor connected with lines to make amazing art, and the visual is really great while the lines tangle into each other and changes shape. As the lines rotate into one direction it shrinks and in other direction is expands which creats amazing visual interaction with the audiences.

*Kinetic Origami with Arduino Servo Sketch*

This project is related to mine because they use a thing called "Arduino Servo Sketch" where it kind of works like an motor, and in this project it was connected with a line where the line is connected to the origami, and as the motor spins, the origami expands and shrinks which creats an amazing visual effect for viewers.

*Carousel*

An carousel is related to my project is becasue it is controlled by an giant motor for it to spin, and in my final version of my project after many different attempts, I have came up with something similar to an carousel. Where in my project the motor controls my platform to spin, I believe that my project shares the same concept with the carousel.

### Related project 6 ###
*Baby-Burping Robot*

This project is related to mine because what they have created is fun, not useful and really entertaining, where it is what I really am aiming for in my project, but also I think that they have used an motor for the robot to spin in a high speed, after all this project is like my final design fantasy where it has all the elements I am looking for in an project.


## Other research ##
*I have also gone through experiment 4 from the inventor's kit to get a better understanding of how the motor works, the coding and how to connect it with the microbits.*

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Everything in my project and process can all be found with a link in my Assessment 2 page under each section where I have referenced either a video, picture or process.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
*An machine/device that has no other use than just entertainment really*

### Design concept 1 ###
A car kind of toy that will move away from users once it is turned on. So the idea of this concept is to create a car toy that will keep moving away from the user once it is turned on, and you will never know which way it will be going the next second, therefore the toy car will be incredibly hard to catch.

After some attempt: After a few attempts on trying to complete this concept, I have failed in creating an motor based toy car, and also that the motor was not able to create enough power to carry the whole breadboard and microbit for an paper made car to move, therefore this concept ended in a failure.

### Design concept 2 ###
An on/off switch that switches it self off like the "useless box" or shares the same concept, just a thing that keeps the users entertained.

After some attempt: After a few attempts with this concept, I have failed with creating an on/off switch for the project, and the line puller didnt work out as i expected where I tried to use the motor as an line puller but there was no switch for the motor to pull, and the other issue i have came accross was that the motor only spins in one direction, for it to change direction i would have to switch the lines connecting the motor around, in result of that this concept ended inan failure.
### Final design concept ###
*An slide of different colors that just keep sliding in a circle, where you can look at it for ages and do nothing, this concept is similar to the related projects 1. *

But unfortunally this concept also ended as a failure, as trying to use the same concept with the related project 1 "forever 21" I have used toilet rolles (as they are the lightest and most stable material i can find) to create a scroll for color papers to spin on, but after connecting with the motor, the motor couldn't create enough force to spin the scroll, and after changing the materialls to think sticks (wood) it was still to heavy for the motor to spin, in my final attempt i have tried using paper to scroll them into a scroll, but the results were the same, and my concept ended in a failure so I had to came up with something different.

What I came up with in the end was an spinning platform made from condensed foam witch is really light, and the motor was able to give it a good spin. This final prototype actually came from another failure concept that I have tried when everything was failing, and that was the display platform, it shares the same concept as the spinning platform, but with the display platform I need it to place something onto the platform for it to "display" but when I try to display something on to it, the condensed foam breaks as it it too light to be haveing pressure on it, there for I have to come up with another idea/concept again. 
Here is a video of it fully functioning : https://youtu.be/cZ09OXe5B98
### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
