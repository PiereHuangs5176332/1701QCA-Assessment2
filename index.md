This project is related to mine because they have used some kind of "motor" to keep the colors changing and spinning, where in my project, I have also used a motor, and in one of my very first attempt of my project I though of the same conecpt where i have a big scroll that changes color as well.

This project is related to mine because they have also used motor in their project, where they use the motor to shake the bottle which while the bottle is shaking the bottle moves from its initial position, we kind of share to same concept on motors and this is also one of the project people can play for a long time and spend time watching it while doing nothing which is what I am looking for for my project.

*Kinetic Wall: Arduino Spiral Wall*

This project is related to mine because they have also used motor in their project, in this project, they use the motor connected with lines to make amazing art, and the visual is really great while the lines tangle into each other and changes shape. As the lines rotate into one direction it shrinks and in other direction is expands which creats amazing visual interaction with the audiences.

*Kinetic Origami with Arduino Servo Sketch*

This project is related to mine because they use a thing called "Arduino Servo Sketch" where it kind of works like an motor, and in this project it was connected with a line where the line is connected to the origami, and as the motor spins, the origami expands and shrinks which creats an amazing visual effect for viewers.

*Carousel*

An carousel is related to my project is becasue it is controlled by an giant motor for it to spin, and in my final version of my project after many different attempts, I have came up with something similar to an carousel. Where in my project the motor controls my platform to spin, I believe that my project shares the same concept with the carousel.

*Baby-Burping Robot*

This project is related to mine because what they have created is fun, not useful and really entertaining, where it is what I really am aiming for in my project, but also I think that they have used an motor for the robot to spin in a high speed, after all this project is like my final design fantasy where it has all the elements I am looking for in an project.


## Other research ##
*I have also gone through experiment 4 from the inventor's kit to get a better understanding of how the motor works, the coding and how to connect it with the microbits.*

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Everything in my project and process can all be found with a link in my Assessment 2 page under each section where I have referenced either a video, picture or process.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
*An machine/device that has no other use than just entertainment really*

### Design concept 1 ###
A car kind of toy that will move away from users once it is turned on. So the idea of this concept is to create a car toy that will keep moving away from the user once it is turned on, and you will never know which way it will be going the next second, therefore the toy car will be incredibly hard to catch.

### Design concept 2 ###
An on/off switch that switches it self off like the "useless box" or shares the same concept, just a thing that keeps the users entertained.

### Final design concept ###
*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
